# Reinforcement-Learning

**Introduction**
The swarming of animal groups has fascinated scientists in fields ranging from
biology to physics to engineering. The complex swarming patterns often arise from
simple interactions between individuals to the benefit of the collective whole. Here we
show that a machine-learning technique can be employed to tune these underlying
parameters and optimize the resulting performance.
In this project we try to simulate a group of fish which try to find preferred regions
in a sea or ocean where there might be less light so that the predator doesn’t find them.
They do it collectively by interacting with each other on an individual level that benefits
the whole swarm.
